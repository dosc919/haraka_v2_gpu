File organization:
main.cpp
  contains testing functions for all implemented cuda functions
  uses windows specific includes and may not run in linux

constants.h
  contains defines used in main.cpp
  
helper.cpp
  contains helper functions used in main.cpp
  
harak_cuda_wrapper.cu
  contains the wrapper functions for the cuda kernels
  this functions should be called when a specific algorithm
  should be executed
  they will call the corresponding cuda kernel from haraka_cuda.cu
  the signing with the Winternitz signature scheme and build in
  private key generation only works under windows system, because
  of the windows specific secure random number genrator
  under linux the private keys have to be suplied in the function header
  
haraka_cuda.cu
  contains the cuda kernels

haraka_cuda_w_options.cu
  contains the wrapper function and cuda kernel for haraka-512
  with options to switch between different memory types for the
  the T-tables and round constatns as well as different granularity
